**Red Coast** (redco) is a lightweight and user-friendly tool designed to automate distributed training and inference for large models while simplifying the ML pipeline development process without necessitating MLSys expertise from users.

RedCoast supports *Large Models* + *Complex Algorithms*, in a *lightweight* and *user-friendly* manner: 

* Large Models beyond Transformers, e.g, [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/tanyuqian/redco/examples/text_to_image), etc.
* Complex algorithms beyond cross entropy, e.g., [Meta Learning](https://github.com/tanyuqian/redco/examples/meta_learning), etc.
